        Args:
          input_dict: Input dict from input key to a list of artifacts, including:
            - model_export: a TFX input channel containing a Model artifact.
            - model_blessing: a TFX input channel containing a ModelBlessing
              artifact.
          output_dict: Output dict from key to a list of artifacts, including:
            - pushed_model: a TFX output channel containing a PushedModel arti
              fact. It contains information where the model is published at an
              d whether the model is pushed or not. furthermore, pushed model
              carries the following information.
              - pushed : integer value to denote if the model is pushed or not.
                This is set to 0 when the input model is not blessed, and it is
                set to 1 when the model is successfully pushed.
              - pushed_version : string value to indicate the current model ver
                sion. This is decided by time.time() Python built-in function.
              - repo_id : model repository ID where the model is pushed to. This
                follows the format of f"{username}/{repo_name}".
              - branch : branch name where the model is pushed to. The branch na
                me is automatically assigned to the same value of pushed_version.
              - commit_id : the id from the commit history (branch name could be
                sufficient to retreive a certain version of the model) of the mo
                del repository.
              - repo_url : model repository URL. It is something like f"https://
                huggingface.co/{repo_id}/{branch}"
              - space_url : space repository URL. It is something like f"https://
                huggingface.co/{repo_id}"f
          exec_properties: An optional dict of execution properties, including:
            - username: username of the HuggingFace user (can be an individual
              user or an organization)
            - access_token: access token value issued by HuggingFace for the s
              pecified username.
            - repo_name: the repository name to push the current version of the
              model to. The default value is same as the TFX pipeline name.
            - space_config: space_config carries additional values such as:
              - app_path : path where the application templates are in the cont
                ainer that runs the TFX pipeline. This is expressed either apps.
                gradio.img_classifier or apps/gradio.img_classifier.
              - repo_name : the repository name to push the application to. The
                default value is same as the TFX pipeline name
              - space_sdk : either gradio or streamlit. this will decide which a
                pplication framework to be used for the Space repository. The de
                fault value is gradio
              - placeholders : dictionary which placeholders to replace with mod
                el specific information. The keys represents describtions, and t
                he values represents the actual placeholders to replace in the f
                iles under the app_path. There are currently two predefined keys,
                and if placeholders is set to None, the default values will be used.
