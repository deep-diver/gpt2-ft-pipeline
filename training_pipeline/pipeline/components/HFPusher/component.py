        HFPusher pushes a trained or blessed model to HuggingFace Model Hub.
        This is designed to work as a downstream component of Trainer and o
        ptionally Evaluator(optional) components. Trainer gives trained mod
        el, and Evaluator gives information whether the trained model is bl
        essed or not after evaluation of the model. HFPusher component only
        publishes a model when it is blessed. If Evaluator is not specified,
        the input model will always be pushed.

        Args:
        username: the ID of HuggingFace Hub
        access_token: the access token obtained from HuggingFace Hub for the
            given username. Refer to [this document](https://huggingface.co/
            docs/hub/security-tokens) to know how to obtain one.
        repo_name: the name of Model Hub repository where the model will be
            pushed. This should be unique name under the username within th
            e Model Hub. repository is identified as {username}/{repo_name}.
        space_config: optional configurations set when to push an application
            to HuggingFace Space Hub. This is a dictionary, and the following
            information could be set.
            app_path: the path where the application related files are stored.
                this should follow the form either of app.gradio.segmentation
                or app/gradio/segmentation. This is a required parameter when
                space_config is set. This could be a local or GCS paths.
            space_sdk: Space Hub supports gradio, streamit, and static types
                of application. The default is set to gradio.
            placeholders: placeholders to replace in every files under the a
                pp_path. This is used to replace special string with the mod
                el related values. If this is not set, the default placehold
                ers will be used as follows.
                ```
                placeholders = {
                    "MODEL_REPO_ID" : "$MODEL_REPO_ID",
                    "MODEL_REPO_URL": "$MODEL_REPO_URL",

                }
                ```
                In this case, "$MODEL_REPO_ID", "$MODEL_REPO_URL", "$MODEL_VE
                RSION" strings will be replaced with appropriate values at ru
                ntime. If placeholders are set, custom strings will be used.
            repo_name: the name of Space Hub repository where the application
                will be pushed. This should be unique name under the username
                within the Space Hub. repository is identified as {username}/
                {repo_name}. If this is not set, the same name to the Model H
                ub repository will be used.
        model: a TFX input channel containing a Model artifact. this is usually
            comes from the standard [`Trainer`]
            (https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/trainer) component.
        model_blessing: a TFX input channel containing a ModelBlessing artifact.
            this is usually comes from the standard [`Evaluator`]
            (https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/evaluator) component.
        Returns:
        a TFX output channel containing a PushedModel artifact. It contains
        information where the model is published at and whether the model is
        pushed or not.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: if app_path is not set when space_config is provided.
        Example:

        Basic usage example:
        ```py
        trainer = Trainer(...)
        evaluator = Evaluator(...)
